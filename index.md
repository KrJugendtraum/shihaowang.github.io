### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a senior student in Shandong University. During this semester I'm in an enhenced programm of graduate study organized by BICMR, after that, I will go to YMSC for a Ph.D. of pure mathematics. I am quite interested in finding connections between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with an algebraic approach. 

Recently I'm learning some quite interesting theories about Yang-Mills functional, a gauge invariant functional defined on the space of connections on G-principle bundles, in which we can apply Morse theory as what we do in Riemannian geometry, in order to finish my undergraduate thesis, about Yang-Mills equations on Riemann surfaces and Moduli space.

### Course notes

Here are some notes I typed during my study in Peking University.
* (Last updated 2022.5.12)[Representation theory](notes/Representation_theory.pdf), lectured by Emanuel Scheidegger.
* (Last updated 2022.4.29)[Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry](notes/Hodge_theory_and_Complex_Algebraic_Geometry.pdf), lectured by Qizheng Yin.  **Attention: There may be a considerable number of errors, since I have quite a lot problems to work out.**
* (Last updated 2022.5.12)[Riemann surface](notes/Riemann_surface.pdf), lectured by Xiaobo Liu.
* (Last updated 2022.5.15)[Homology theory](notes/homology.pdf), lectured by Huabing Ge.
