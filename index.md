### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a PhD student in Mathematics Department of Tsinghua University from Sept 2022, under the supervision of [chenglong yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/). My research interest lies in the intersection of complex differential geometry and complex algebraic geometry.  

Here is my email: liubw22 [at] mails.tsinghua.edu.cn. Please contact me if you find any mistake in my notes or have any advice, and thanks in advance


### Seminars
* (2023Fall, last updated 2023/08/26)There is a seminar organized by Shengyu Hou, Chenchen Zuo and me about toric variety.
   - [syllabus](notes/2023Fall/toric/syllabus.pdf).
   - [notes](notes/2023Fall/toric/toric_variety.pdf) of talks I gave.
* (2023Spring)[Principal bundle and its application](notes/2023Spring/geometry_of_principal_bundle.pdf). In this lecture, firstly we introduce principal bundle and connections on it, the most important ingredients of this part are local computations. Then we introduce its applications on Chern-Weil theory.
* (2022Fall) Here are the lecture notes of talks I gave in a seminar about Bott-tu's GTM82, which is organized by [chenglong yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/),
   - [Čech cohomology](notes/2022Fall/Cech_cohomology.pdf).
   - [Spectral sequence and its application](notes/2022Fall/Spectral_sequence.pdf).
 * (2022Summer, last updated 2023/01/30) Here is the draft of lecture note I typed for a seminar about [communicative algebra](notes/2022Summer/note_for_communicative_algebra.pdf).


### Personal notes/slides
* (Last updated 2023/09/18)[Algebraic geometry](notes/2023Fall/algebraic_geometry.pdf)It's a note I typed when I'm learning algebraic geometry from course taught by Lei Fu in 2023Fall
* (Last updated 2023/09/12)[Symmetric space](notes/personal notes/Symmetric_space/note.pdf).
* (2023/06/27)Here are [note](notes/personal notes/Review_of_topology/note.pdf) and [slides](notes/personal notes/Review_of_topology/slides.pdf) for a review of topology frequently used in geometry, discussed with Zhiyao Xiong, Zhitong Chen.
* (2023/06/08)Here are [note](notes/personal notes/Uniqueness_CPn/note.pdf) and [slides](notes/personal notes/Uniqueness_CPn/slides.pdf) for my final report of course “advanced topics in complex geometry", lectured by Xiaokui Yang, and topic of the final report is the uniqueness of the K\"ahler structure of complex projective space.
* (Last updated 2023/08/03)[Complex geometry I](notes/personal notes/Complex_geometry_I/Complex_geometry_I.pdf). It's a lecture note about complex differential geometry. The initial draft of this note is taken in 2022Spring, in the course about Hodge theory taught by [Qizheng Yin](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~qizheng/#), and that's my first time to learn this beautiful theory. Later in 2023Spring I added more useful techniques and advanced topics (such as Schwarz computations, Calabi-Yau theorem and so on) I learnt in the course “advanced topics in complex geometry" given by Xiaokui Yang. I also added some other materials from classical books to make this note self-contained.
* [Partial differential equation](notes/2022Fall/pde.pdf), it's a note I typed when I'm learning PDE in 2022Fall, and it's mainly followed the standard textbook written by Evans.
