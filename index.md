### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, just a lover of mathmatics(smile). I am quite interested in exploring relations between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with an algebraic approach. 

This summer maybe quite busy but interesting for me. 

### Course notes

Here are some notes I typed during my study in enhanced program of BICMR in Peking University. 
* (Done)[Representation theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Representation_theory.pdf), lectured by Emanuel Scheidegger. Here is [tex file](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Representation_theory.zip). Attention: There are still too many mistakes, typos and lack of logic. Maybe one day in future I will make it better, when I do need representation theory. 
* (Last updated 2022.7.4)[Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Hodge_theory_and_Complex_Algebraic_Geometry.pdf), lectured by Qizheng Yin. Here is [tex file](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry.zip).
* (Done)[Riemann surface](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Riemann_surface.pdf), lectured by Xiaobo Liu. Here is [tex file](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Riemann_surface.zip).
* (Done)[Homology theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/homology.pdf), lectured by Huabing Ge. Here is [tex file](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/homology.zip).

### Seminars

* (Last updated 2022.7.4)Here is the draft of lecture notes for a summer seminar about GTM82 I take participate in, [Draft](notes/Draft_of_82.pdf)

* Here will be a part of solution for atiyah's commutative algebra.

### Drafts

* Here is the draft of my undergraduate thesis, [Draft](notes/Draft_of_undergraduate_thesis.pdf)

This article is a lecture on Yang-Mills functional, a gauge invariant functional defined on the space of connections on G-principle bundles. By considering the first variation of Yang-Mills functional we obtain the Yang-Mills equations, and the solutions are called Yang-Mills connections. There are too many interesting applications of Yang-Mills connections, and my lecture focuses on the its relations to stability of holomorphic structures of vector bundle over a Riemann surface, or in a fancy word, its moduli space.
