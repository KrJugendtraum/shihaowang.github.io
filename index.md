### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a senior student in Shandong University. During this semester I'm in an enhenced program of graduate study organized by BICMR. After that, I will go to YMSC for a Ph.D. of pure mathematics. I am quite interested in exploring connections between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with an algebraic approach. 

Recently I'm fixing typos and mistakes I made in notes I typed during this semester in order to review what I have learnt. I also applied for a summer program about complex geometry and the deformation about complex structure organized by Tianyuan Mathematical Center in Northeast China. Maybe I will do some preparations for it if time permitted.

### Drafts

Here is the draft of my undergraduate thesis, [Draft](notes/Draft.pdf)

This article is a lecture on Yang-Mills functional, a gauge invariant functional defined on the space of connections on G-principle bundles. By considering the first variation we obtain the Yang-Mills equations, and the solutions are just critical points of Yang-Mills functionals, which are called Yang-Mills connections. There are too many interesting applications of Yang-Mills connections, and my lecture focuses on the its relations to stability of holomorphic structures of vector bundle over a Riemann surface, in other words, its moduli space.
