### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, just a lover of mathmatics(smile). I am quite interested in exploring relations between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with an algebraic approach. 


### Seminars

* (2022Summer, last updated 2023.1.30) Here is the draft of lecture note I typed for a seminar about [communicative algebra](notes/2022Summer/note_for_communicative_algebra.pdf).
* (2022Fall, done) Here are the lecture notes of talks I gave, in a seminar about Bott-tu's gtm82, which is organized by chenglong yu,
   - [CÌŒech cohomology](notes/2022Fall/Cech_cohomology.pdf)
   - [Spectral sequence and its application](notes/2022Fall/Spectral_sequence.pdf)
* (2023Spring, last updated 2023.1.23) Here is the draft of lecture note I typed for a seminar about [principal bundle and its application](notes/2023Spring/geometry_of_principal_bundle.pdf), which is organized by myself.
  


### Course notes

#### 2022Spring

Here are some notes I typed during my study in enhanced program of BICMR in Peking University. 
* (Done)[Representation theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Representation_theory.pdf), lectured by Emanuel Scheidegger. Attention: There are still too many mistakes, typos and lack of logic. Maybe one day in future I will make it better, when I do need representation theory. 
* (Last updated 2022.7.17)[Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Hodge_theory_and_Complex_Algebraic_Geometry.pdf), lectured by Qizheng Yin.
* (Done)[Riemann surface](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Riemann_surface.pdf), lectured by Xiaobo Liu.
* (Done)[Homology theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/homology.pdf), lectured by Huabing Ge.


#### 2022Fall
* (Last updated 2022.12.24)[Riemannian geometry](notes/2022Fall/Riemannian_geo.pdf), lectured by Xiaokui Yang, I also added some related materials.
* (Done)[Partial differential equation](notes/2022Fall/pde.pdf), mainly followed standard textbook written by Evans.


### TA
