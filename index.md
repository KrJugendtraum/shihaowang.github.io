### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a senior student in Shandong University. During this semester I'm in an enhenced programm of graduate study organized by BICMR, after that, I will goto YMSC for a Ph.D. of pure mathematics. I am quite interested in finding connections between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with algebraic approach. Recently I'm reading some theories about GIT and symplectic reduction, in order to finish my graduate thesis, about Yang-Mills equations on Riemann surfaces and Moduli space.

### Course notes

Here are some notes I written during my study in Peking University
