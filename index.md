### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Shihao Wang, an undergratuate student of Tsinghua University from Sept 2022, under the supervision of [Chenglong Yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/). My research interests focus on the non-abelian Hodge theory over characteristic zero and positive characteristic. Also, I'm interested in the stability of Higgs bundles and related topics.

My email is liubw22 [at] mails [dot] tsinghua [dot] edu [dot] cn, and my workstation is S103 at C740 of Shuangqing Complex Building A. Please contact me by email or let's have a coffee at Shuangqing if you find any mistake in my notes, and all comments are welcomed.
